A Management System for Local General Practitioner's Office 

A management system for local general practitioner’s (GP) office was developed to include added functions for patients and doctors that are currently not found in existing software. These functions allow patients to view the status of their prescription without having to contact the GP’s office staff, the patient can view all the doctors available hours and the doctors can add and modify their available hours as required. The system was created using web pages and a database that were extensively planned and thought through before implementation. Once the system was implemented, a successful management system was achieved which included the above mentioned new features. The user interface was made appealing and attractive to encourage users to engage with it. Specific user testing was carried out and the results concluded that the system was user friendly and the new additions were very much welcomed by the respective users. It was found that the system was satisfactory for a small GP’s office but it could include other features to enhance it, which was discovered during testing. Therefore, the task of building a functioning web application for a local GP’s office to manage records with additional features was completed.
